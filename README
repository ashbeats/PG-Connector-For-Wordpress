What does this Connector do?

ProxyGoblin's Connector alters WPsBox to use proxies from a text file.

Without this connector, you would have to manually copy & paste proxies
to the settings window. But with this plugin, you can automatically upload proxies
using FTP to your WPsBox from within the Goblin.
